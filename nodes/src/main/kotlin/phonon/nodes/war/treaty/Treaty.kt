/**
 * Peace treaty system.
 * 
 * Peace treaties are created for (town1, town2) pairs.
 * If either town has a nation, the town capital is used for treaties.
 * Treaties can occur at any time (even without war).import
 * 
 * Treaty objects are stored in memory, until it is either
 * rejected, deleted, or executed. If either side does not view it,
 * the treaty will hang in limbo.
