# Design Decisions

This contains a list of miscellaneous design decisions and reasoning.

## Default cannot place war flags under water, require air/sky access.
If players could claim under water, then coastal cities bordering
non-territory water would always be at a massive disadvantage.
Players could directly attack someone's home. Even increased claim
time multipliers on home + coastal chunk would not compensate
for being able to just directly attack someone's home immediately.
