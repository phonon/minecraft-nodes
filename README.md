# Build
This repository contains the following separate projects:
1.  Nodes main server plugin (root directory)
2.  Dynmap viewer/editor
3.  Plugin documentation
4.  Ports plugin



## 1. Building main server plugin
Requirements:
- Java JDK 16 (current plugin target java version)

**This build example will be for version 1.16.5, currently
the only supported version.** 

Building the main plugin requires Minecraft NMS, so first step
will be to build spigot and craftbukkit jars:
- https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/buildtools/
- https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/spigot-nms-and-minecraft-versions-1-16/

### 1. Download BuildTools.jar: https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/buildtools/#running-buildtools


### 2. Run BuildTool.jar to build `spigot-1.16.5.jar`.
```
java -jar BuildTools.jar --rev 1.16.5
```

### 3. Put `spigot-1.16.5.jar` into `nodes/lib/block_edit/lib/`.
This folder should now have path:
```
nodes/lib/block_edit/lib/spigot-1.16.5.jar
```

### 4. Build `block_edit` lib:
Go inside `nodes/lib/block_edit/` and run.
```
./gradlew build -P 1.16
```
*Note: this had to be split out because of a gson version 
conflict between spigot and nodes. If this is resolved,
then fast block editing can be pushed into main source.*


### 5. Build final plugin `nodes.jar`:
Go inside `nodes/` and run
```
./gradlew build -P 1.16
```
Built `.jar` will appear in `build/libs/*.jar`.


### 6. *(Optional)* Build final plugin without `kotlin`:
By default the build process shadows kotlin runtime dependency
into the `nodes.jar` so that it can be used as a standalone plugin.
In situations where `kotlin` runtime is shared across plugins,
this will build `nodes` without kotlin:
```
./gradlew build -P 1.16 -P no-kotlin
```
Nodes instead has a soft dependency on any plugin named `kotlin`.
This is intended for use with this kotlin runtime plugin:

-----------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Building dynmap viewer/editor
*See internal folder `dynmap/README.md` for more details*

Requirements:
- node.js
- Rust

-----------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Building plugin documentation
### Generating main plugin documentation
*See `docs/README.md`*

Requirements:
- Rust

### Generating nodes commands documentation
Requirements:
- Python 3

This script reads in documentation comments from in-game command
files in `src/main/kotlin/phonon/nodes/commands/*` and generates
documentation for in-game commands:
```
python scripts/generate_commands_docs.py
```
Run this in the git root directory every time in-game commands
are edited in `nodes/` source before re-building documentation site.

-----------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Building ports plugin
Requirements:
- Java JDK 16 (current plugin target java version)

### 1. Build main `nodes` plugin first (follow steps above).
Make sure there is the nodes output `.jar` at path
```
nodes/build/libs/nodes.jar
```

### 2. Build ports plugin `nodes-ports.jar`:
Go inside `ports/` and run
```
./gradlew build -P 1.16
```
Built `.jar` will appear in `build/libs/nodes-ports-1.16-*.jar`.
